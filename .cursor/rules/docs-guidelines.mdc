- When implementing features or infrastructure, always include documentation on how to set them up and use them.  
- Place detailed or lengthy setup instructions and guides in the `docs/` folder.  
- Update the main `README.md` with concise, high-level summaries or links to the detailed docs.  
- Ensure all documentation is clear, complete, and accurate for future developers.
